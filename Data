## 📁 Files

- **`thermoelectric_dataset_model2.csv`**  
  A cleaned version of the Excel file used in Model-2. Contains ~5200 samples derived from telluride and selenide thermoelectric compounds.  
  Columns include:
  - `Material`
  - `Temperature (K)`
  - `Z_mean`, `Electronegativity_mean`, `Density_mean`, etc.
  - Target variables:
    - `Lattice Thermal Conductivity (W/mK)`
    - `Seebeck Coefficient (µV/K)`
    - `Electrical Conductivity (S/m)`

- **`candidate_test_set1.xlsx`**  
  Telluride-based compounds used to test generalization.

- **`candidate_test_set2.xlsx`**  
  Chemically diverse compounds to assess extrapolation capabilities.
